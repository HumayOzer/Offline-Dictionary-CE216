# Welcome to our Offline Translator !

There are three different sections of our application: Translator: In the translator section, when the user enters a word and presses the enter key, the user can see translations in all languages. And so we did. Selection box button because if a word is in more than one language, we asked you to select the language of the word you entered from this button to get the desired translation. After you enter the word and press the button right below it, languages with that word will appear on the choicebox and it asks you to choose. It also has the ability to edit translations by pressing the Edit button. The exit can be made by pressing the Exit button.

October: In the October section, the user must also enter the equivalent of the word he entered in other languages, so a new word and its translations will be added to our dictionary.So you will support the best and most efficient operation of our program, and we developers will be very happy!!

Exit: Exit can be made by pressing the exit button.
