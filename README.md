# Welcome to our Offline Translator !

Our application has three different sections: Tranlator, Add and Help.

Translator: When the user enters a word, a language must be chosen in the choicebox located right below the textfield. Then the user should press the "Search Word" button. If no language is written in the choicebox, it means that there is no translation for that word. After user receives the translation of the word they wrote, user can edit the textfields on the right side and click to the "Update Word" button so that the edit is made by the user will be saved.

Add: In the Add section, the user must select the source and target languages. Then a new translation can be added by filling in the Native and Localized textfield fields on the right side and pressing the "Enter" button.

Help: There is a text in the Help section that will provide information to user about the use of the software.
