# Welcome to our Offline Translator !

Our application has three different sections: Tranlator, Add and Help.

Translator: When the user enters the word, he must choose from the languages that have that word in the choicebox located immediately below the textfield. Then he should press the "Search Word" button. If no language is written in choicebox, it means that there is no translation for that word. After the user receives the translation of the word he wrote, when he edits the textfields on the right side and types in the "Update Word" button, the edit he made will be saved.

Add: In the Add section, the user must select the source and target languages. Then, it can add a new translation by filling in the Native and Localized textfield fields on the right side and pressing the "Enter" button.

Help: There is text in the Help section that will provide information to the user about the use of the software.
